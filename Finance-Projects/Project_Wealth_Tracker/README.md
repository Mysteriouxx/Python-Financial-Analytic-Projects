# Project Wealth_Tracker: Comprehensive Wealth Monitoring Tool

## Overview
The "Wealth Tracker" project challenges you to design and develop a comprehensive tool that aggregates and tracks a clientâ€™s wealth across various asset classes. The tool should provide a consolidated view of the client's financial status, enabling them to monitor their investments, assess performance, and make informed decisions. The final deliverable will be a Python-based application that performs this wealth aggregation and presents the data in a clear, user-friendly format.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to create a wealth tracking tool that consolidates financial data from multiple sources into a single, cohesive view. The tool should allow the client to easily track the performance of their investments, monitor changes in net worth, and gain insights into the allocation and risk of their portfolio.

## Case Scenario
### Client Profile
Sarah Li is a 45-year-old successful entrepreneur based in Hong Kong. Over the past two decades, she has built a diverse investment portfolio that includes stocks, bonds, real estate, and alternative investments like private equity. Sarah is highly focused on growing her wealth while maintaining a balanced risk profile. However, as her portfolio has grown more complex, she finds it increasingly difficult to track the performance and value of her investments manually. 

### Current Challenge
Sarah currently holds assets across multiple accounts with different financial institutions. She has a stock portfolio that she manages actively, a bond ladder for steady income, several rental properties, and stakes in private equity deals. Each type of asset is reported separately by the respective institutions, and Sarah lacks a unified view of her total wealth. This fragmentation makes it difficult for her to make informed decisions about rebalancing her portfolio, assessing risk, or tracking her progress toward her financial goals.

### Project Assignment
Sarah has approached you to build a wealth tracking tool that can aggregate all her financial data into a single, consolidated platform. She needs a tool that can provide her with a real-time view of her total wealth, broken down by asset class, and allow her to easily monitor the performance of her investments. The tool should also offer basic visualizations, such as portfolio value over time, asset allocation breakdown, and risk exposure.

## Expected Deliverable
**Wealth Tracker Tool:**
Develop a Python-based application or Jupyter notebook that aggregates Sarah's financial data across various asset classes and presents a unified view of her total wealth. The tool should:
- **Data Aggregation:** Consolidate data from different accounts (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate).
- **Performance Tracking:** Monitor the performance of these assets over time, providing metrics such as total value, returns, and income.
- **Visualization:** Include basic visualizations that help Sarah understand the allocation of her assets, trends in her portfolio value, and her exposure to different types of risk.

### Key Features to Implement:
1. **Unified Dashboard:** A single view where Sarah can see her total wealth, broken down by asset class.
2. **Performance Monitoring:** Tools to track changes in the value of her investments over time.
3. **Asset Allocation Visualization:** Charts that show how Sarah's investments are distributed across different asset classes.
4. **Risk Exposure:** Basic metrics or visualizations that highlight the risk associated with her portfolio, such as asset concentration or historical volatility.

## Instructions
You are tasked with building the Wealth Tracker tool from scratch. You will need to:
- Identify relevant data sources and methods for aggregating financial data across multiple asset classes.
- Design and implement data processing techniques to ensure that the information is accurate and up-to-date.
- Develop a user-friendly interface or notebook layout that allows Sarah to interact with the tool and easily access the insights she needs.
- Ensure that the tool provides useful visualizations that can guide Sarah's investment decisions.

The final deliverable should be a single Python-based tool (or notebook) that Sarah can use on an ongoing basis to track her wealth and monitor the performance of her investments.
